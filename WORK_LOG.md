| Jan 8  | 11:15-11:45 am |                                                                                               I took code from Mr. Blick's slides. I adjusted it for words. I used hashmap and hash set. |
| Jan 10 | 9:15 - 9:45 pm |                        During class period, I edited my code. I was able to get the small tests running. I coudl do this by setting the cell to unvisited after all the recursive calls. |
| Jan 12 | 4:00 - 4:30 pm |                                                                        I realized that hash map isn't working. This was because of the large data sets. I added TST code to the project. |
| Jan 12 |  5 - 5:30 pm   |                                                         The TST code file was not compiling and was giving Node not found error. I had to delete cache. I had to reset the project file. |
| Jan 12 |  5:30 - 6 pm   | It began working after that. I revised the code. I did this to give substring match information. This helped me not do useless DFS recursion if the earlier substrings weren't matching. |
| Jan 12 |  7 - 7:30 pm   |                                                                                                             I was able to pass all the tests. I added comments. I re-checked everything. |
